## Notes

<!-- Content_START -->
### 2025.02.06
I finished the protocol wiki week0 and week1.
And this blog post from Vitalik: https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2017/09/14/prehistory.html
The wiki is awesome, it provide very useful resource to me.

### 2025.02.07
Today I learn the protocol overview and the protocol introduction in protocol wiki. I already know the protocol architecture contains the execution and consensus layer but do not know much about the details. I read the breakdown and gain more insight about Ethereum core!

### 2025.02.08
Read the week2 recording on the study group wiki and read the content regarding the execution layer. Complete the EL Specs part!

### 2025.02.09
Today, start learning some fundamentals for Pectra's next upgrade, which will include the EOF updates. The changes are documented in EIP-7692. This upgrade significantly impacts the execution layer, so it includes a large number of EIPs!

### 2025.02.10
Watching the video for introducing the EOF and some examples in the update: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKVgCoNp39g.

### 2025.02.12
Watch this video to learn stack validation algorithm in EOF upgrade: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80szRrNW0MM
It is hard to learn purely from EIP, but the video demonstration is clear.
